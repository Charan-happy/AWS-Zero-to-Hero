Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR is designed to be highly reliable, scalable, and secure. It can be used with any Docker-compatible container orchestration service, such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon ECS, or your own on-premises Kubernetes cluster.

With Amazon ECR, you can:

Store and manage your Docker container images in a private registry.
Easily deploy your container images to Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS clusters, or Amazon EKS clusters.
Use the Amazon ECR API or the AWS CLI to manage your container images.
Integrate Amazon ECR with your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
